Play databases with Adminer and Docker
When you use Docker with a database you need a client to operate on it. A simple and clean solution is to install a client in a Docker container. With that, no need to install anything on your computer besides Docker. Many clients exists, like PHPMyAdmin, but we want one that can connect to different database, not just MySQL/MariaDB.
Adminer seems a good choice.

The prerequisites for this article is to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

$ docker version && docker-compose version
Versions used in this article :

Docker : 17.12.0-ce ;
Docker Compose : 1.17.0 ;
Adminer : 4.5.0 ;
Postgres : 10 ;
MySQL : 8.0.3 ;
MongoDB : 3.6.2
Install Adminer
Create a file “docker-compose.yml” in your project directory.

version: '3.1'
   services:
       adminer:
           image: dockette/adminer:full-php5
           restart: always
           ports:
              - 8080:8080
              
              
Some explanations :

“dockette/adminer:full-php5” is an unofficial image working with PHP 5 instead of PHP 7 ;
“restart” the container will be restart each time when the Docker service will be up ;
“8080” on the left side is the external port. If this port is already using you should change it ;
“8080” on the right side is the internal port. Please don’t change !
Why don’t we use the official Adminer image ? You can use it, but it will not works with Mongo and PHP7.

> https://hub.docker.com/_/adminer
The following drivers are not supported by this image:
MongoDB (The driver is not supported by PHP 7)
You can run this container with the command

$ docker-compose up
(make sure your are in the same root of the “docker-compose.yml”). If the container is up, you can connect to http://localhost:8080.


Working but we don’t have database server yet.


Postgres
Prepare the server
In the same file (in the “services” column).

dbPostgres:
    image: postgres:10
    restart: always
    ports:
        - 5432:5432
    environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: root
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme
        POSTGRES_DB: mydb
        
        
        
Some explanations :

“postgres:10” is the official image of the 10 version ;
“restart: always” means restart the service each time the Docker daemon is restarted ;
“5432” (on the left side) is the external port. If this port is already using you should change it ;
“5432” (on the right side) is the internal port. Please don’t change it!
“POSTGRES_USER” is the login ;
“POSTGRES_PASSWORD” is the password ;
“POSTGRES_DB” is the name of the database.
If the Adminer container is still running, stop it with CTRL-C and then run

$ docker-compose up
Connection with Adminer and Postgres
Go back in Adminer (http://localhost:8080). Then complete the form :

“System” : select “PostgresSQL” ;
“Server” : type “dbPostgres” ;
“Username” : type “root” ;
“Password” : type “changeme” ;
“Database” : type “mydb” ;
Click “login” button.
MySQL
Prepare the server
In the same file (in the “services” column).

dbMysql:
    image: mysql:8.0.3
    restart: always
    environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: changeme
        MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
        
        
Some explanations :

“mysql:8.0.3” is the official image of the 8.0.3 version (or “mariadb” in you want to use MariaDB) ;
“restart: always” means restart the service each time the Docker daemon is restarted ;
“3306” (on the left side) is the external port. If this port is already using you should change it ;
“3306” (on the right side) is the internal port. Please don’t change it!
“MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD” is the password ;
“MYSQL_DATABASE” is the name of the database.
With MySQL you can choose a simple user with `MYSQL_USER` and`MYSQL_PASSWORD`.

If the Adminer container is still running, stop it with CTRL-C and then run

$ docker-compose up
Connection with Adminer and MySQL
Go back in Adminer (http://localhost:8080). Then complete the form :

“System” : select “MySQL” ;
“Server” : type “dbMysql” ;
“Username” : type “root” ;
“Password” : type “changeme” ;
“Database” : type “mydb” ;
Click “login” button.
MongoDB
In the same file (in the “services” column).

dbMongo:
    image: mongo:3.6.2
    restart: always
    ports:
        - 27017:27017
    environment:
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: changeme
        
        
Some explanations :

“mongo:3.6.2” is the official image of the 3.6.2 version ;
“restart: always” means restart the service each time the Docker daemon is restarted ;
“27017” (on the left side) is the external port. If this port is already using you should change it ;
“27017” (on the right side) is the internal port. Please don’t change it!
“MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME” : is the login ;
“MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD” is the password root.
If the Adminer container is still running, stop it with CTRL-C and then run

$ docker-compose up
Connection with Adminer and MongoDB
Go back in Adminer (http://localhost:8080). Then complete the form :

“System” : select “Mongo” ;
“Server” : type “dbMongo” ;
“Username” : type “root” ;
“Password” : type “changeme” ;
“Database” : leave empty ;
Click “login” button.
